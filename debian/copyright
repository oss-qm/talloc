Talloc was Debianized by Jelmer Vernooij <jelmer@samba.org> on 
Mon Apr 30 01:48:43 CEST 2007.

It was obtained from the Samba projects' Subversion repository. 
The tarball was created by running:
svn export svn://svn.samba.org/samba/tags/TALLOC_`echo -n $VERSION | tr . _` talloc-$VERSION
cd talloc-$VERSION && ./autogen.sh && cd ..
tar cvz talloc-$VERSION > talloc_$VERSION.orig.tar.gz

where VERSION should be replaced with the version of talloc (currently 1.0).
